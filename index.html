<h3>Why a women only CTF team?</h3>
<p>
  Playing CTFs is fun. We would like to see more women doing so, and we would like to see more women in InfoSec.
  Solving challenges can be very rewarding. 
  It allows you to test and improve your hacking skills without any discrimination.
  
  We learned from blackhoodie events, that women only environments can be extremely encouraging for female hackers.
